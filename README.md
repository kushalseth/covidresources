# #MyCovid: Covid Patient's Reviews

- I am tring to build an application that can be actually useful for
  covid scenarios of India or any other developing country.
- Check jumbotronblock.js for Thoughts In Progress.
- Oh my god, it's just a week and more then 100 websites, search
  applications published. How people are reacting on those. These
  links are good but ground reality is different. You cannot make a
  true search application, until you are getting the correct data from
  the hospitals. I would not say these websites are useless. They are
  helpful in getting the leads of what exists. And you can go to
  ground and check the reality. But is it feasible?
- Now what will happen to this application, which I am building. There
  is no need to put another link on google. Then I thought, why not
  just use government websites to get the data. But again, government
  website's data also does not match. We need something that is
  actually useful.
- I guess, An application that can publish the reviews of the Patients
  who has already suffered from covid will be helpful. Where he can
  share his actual experience. In which hospital, he was admitted, how
  were the services, from where he actually get the information and
  leads, etc. Yes that is something that will actually help.

# Technical Snapshot of Application

- Build with keeping in mind to make modular React components.
- We will be integrating advace searches moving forward.
- Initial we will be hosting on github pages. later may move to Azure, based on requirements.
- We are open for any technical, functional advices and connections.
